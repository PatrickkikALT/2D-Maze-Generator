  description: 'Hey!

    This is a job based maze generator using the depth first
    search/recursive backtrack algorithm that visualizes it using tilemaps.

    I
    chose for tilemaps because they''re cheaper than using standard prefabs.

    It
    also comes with another job based solver that colors the path green.

    The
    maze''s size on camera will change based on the device used, I''ve tested this
    with Unity''s Simulator for iPad 4 Mini and the iPhone 12. You can simulate this
    via the enum input in the MoveToMaze script on the camera.
